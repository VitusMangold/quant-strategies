# Quantitative Trading Strategies

This repository collects Jupyter notebooks developed in the context of the **Hedge Fund Club Mannheim’s Learning Sessions on *Public Markets and Portfolio Management***.  

The work reflects my journey from participant to lecturer:  
- **WS2024**: As part of the course assessment, I developed a **pairs trading strategy** (statistical arbitrage) and implemented it in Python.  
- **WS2025**: As **Director of Education**, I prepared and presented a session on **options-based trend-following**, expanding the program with option pricing, event-driven strategies, and systematic backtesting.  

The projects aim to bridge theory and practice: from pricing models and econometrics to full strategy implementation and evaluation.

## Repository Structure

- **`options_trend_following/`**  
  Notebook and materials for an **options-based trend-following strategy**.  
  Covers the Black–Scholes model, payoff visualizations, event-driven option pricing, and a trend-following implementation.  
  - [View README](options_trend_following/README.md)

- **`pairs_trading/`**  
  Notebook and materials for a **statistical arbitrage strategy using pairs trading**.  
  Includes cointegration testing, spread construction, backtesting, and regime detection with the ADX indicator.  
  - [View README](pairs_trading/README.md)

## Techniques & Tools
- **Techniques**: Option pricing, econometrics, statistical arbitrage, trend following, regime classification, backtesting  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels, yfinance  

## Example Outputs
Each folder contains example plots generated by the strategies, e.g.:  
- Equity curves for trend-following with options  
- ADX-based trend strength classification for pairs trading
