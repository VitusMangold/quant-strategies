# Quantitative Trading Strategies

This repository collects Jupyter notebooks developed for the Hedge Fund Club Mannheim.  
Each session introduces core concepts of quantitative finance and demonstrates how to design, implement, and backtest systematic trading strategies in Python.  

The projects aim to bridge theory and practice: from pricing models and econometrics to full strategy implementation and evaluation.
